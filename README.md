# Workspace Theme

This extension lets you set a theme per workspace. This is a nice way to distinguish different workspaces you may have open at the same time.

## Features

- Preview the new theme while selecting

## Usage

Use Command+Shift+P and select "Set Workspace Theme". Then select a theme to apply to the current workspace only. To go back to the default, select the "Restore Default Theme" option.
